<p> This is where someone could make it display all the shifts in a cool way? make each
A moveable object, so that they could play with the schedule? </p>

<p> This is how you would loop through an object</p>
<p>Every things else in this file is HTML or inline css or javascript whatever you need</p>
<p>for template stuff go to https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/ref/templates/builtins/ </p>

    {{ shift }}
{% endfor %}
